Railway OAuth Backend Deployment
This package contains the complete OAuth backend that handles GoHighLevel authentication.

Files to Deploy
index.js - Main server file with OAuth endpoints
package.json - Dependencies and configuration
Railway Deployment Steps
1. Upload Files
Copy index.js and package.json to your Railway project
Or connect Railway to a GitHub repository containing these files
2. Set Environment Variables
In your Railway dashboard, add these variables:

GHL_CLIENT_ID=68474924a586bce22a6e64f7-mbpkmyu4
GHL_CLIENT_SECRET=[Your GoHighLevel Client Secret]
GHL_REDIRECT_URI=https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback
Important: You must provide your GoHighLevel Client Secret from your marketplace app settings.

3. Deploy
Railway will automatically deploy when you push the files.

Testing After Deployment
Health Check
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/health
Should return:

{"status":"OK","service":"GHL OAuth Backend","timestamp":"..."}
OAuth URL Generation
curl https://oauth-backend-production-68c5.up.railway.app/api/oauth/url
Should return:

{
  "success": true,
  "authUrl": "https://marketplace.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/chooselocation?...",
  "state": "oauth_...",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
Architecture
The backend handles the complete OAuth flow:

GET /api/oauth/url - Generates OAuth authorization URLs
GET /api/oauth/callback - Processes GoHighLevel callbacks and exchanges codes for tokens
GET /health - Health check endpoint
Frontend Integration
Your Replit frontend at https://dir.engageautomations.com/oauth.html will:

Call /api/oauth/url to get authorization URL
Redirect user to GoHighLevel
User returns to /api/oauth/callback
Backend exchanges code for tokens
User redirected to success page
Token Storage
The backend logs received tokens to the console. You'll need to add database integration to store:

Access tokens
Refresh tokens
User location/company IDs
Token expiration times
Look for === TOKEN STORAGE NEEDED === in the console logs to see the actual tokens received during OAuth flow.
